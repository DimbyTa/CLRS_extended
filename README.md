# CLRS_extended
A GNN inspired by the example in the examples directory of CLRS ( Veličković et al., The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark, 2022. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.15659).

This repository contains the notebook where:
* My personal implementation of HLFlow is tested against Google OR-Tools
* A single processor GNN is used to learn the behavior of the Highest Label preFlow algorithm.
The notebook was executed on Kaggle and used the GPU Nvidia T4 x2.

This work was done in the context of my Master's thesis in Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics.
